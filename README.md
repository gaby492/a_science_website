# Overview 
The main idea is the creation of a website for a specific group of work which could be an ecological association or one of those groups whose purpose is the monitoring of species, so that they can share the content of their projects. 


# Vision and Goals 

The main goal of this project is the development of a space that allows a specific group of work, like the ones related with the study of climate change or any other topic associated with the environment and nature;   to put together all of the material related with their projects, such as collected data or access to their published papers, photographs, schemes, videos and experiences; and share them with any person interested in nature and environment.
